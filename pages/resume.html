                        <p><b>Abstract:</b> The Trends in International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) is a series of international assessments given to 4th grade and 8th grade students around the world. It is administered by both the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and Boston College (BC) who first conducted the assessments in 1995 and re-administered them every 4 years after that (1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015). The TIMSS dataset contains information on how every participating student answered each question on the test. The dataset also provides supplemental information on the individual student, the student's teacher,  student's school, and the student's country. While the TIMSS dataset is provided in only <b>SPSS</b> and <b>SAS</b> formats, suggesting that most analysis is done in those languages, I will use <b>R</b> to explore the TIMSS dataset. I will show how different tools in the <b>R</b> ecosystem can be used to tidy the TIMSS dataset as well as create and explore new insights in an already deep dataset. I will take a particularly deep look into how individual students and countries performed on each question. Once the dataset is cleaned, I will create different models in an attempt to predict how a student will perform on a particular question on the TIMSS tests. The process of tidying and modeling the TIMSS dataset will show how quickly and easily such tasks can be done in <b>R</b>.</p>
