                        <p><b>Workshop:</b> <i>Graphs: A Data Structure to Query</i></p>
                        <p><b>Outline:</b> When people think of graphs they often think about mapping out social media connections on a plot. While graphs are indeed useful for mapping social networks, they offer so much more. Graphs provide a data structure that scales very well and can be queried in intuitive ways. Data structures in the real world resemble nodes and edges more than they resemble rows and columns. By combining magrittr and igraph, we can traverse (query) in a similar manner as the Gremlin query language to explore our data via its intrinsic relationships. This tutorial will cover:</p>

                          <li>A survey of graphs and their use cases.</li>
                          <li>An introduction to igraph and magrittr.</li>
                          <li>A case study of how traversing a graph allows for the foundation of a recommendations system.</li>
                          <li>A survey of the graph ecosystem.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>My goal is to get useRs excited about graphs. While there will be code, the primary focus is answering the question “what is possible with graphs?” not the question “how does one make a graph?”</p>

                        <p><b>Abstract:</b> When people think of graphs, they often think about mapping out social media connections. While graphs are indeed useful for mapping out social networks, they have many other practical applications. Data in the real world resemble vertices and edges more than they resemble rows and columns. This allows researchers to intuitively grasp the data modeled and stored within a graph. Graph exploration -- also known as graph traversal -- is traditionally done with a traversal language such as Gremlin or Cypher. The functionality of these traversal languages can be duplicated by combining the <i>igraph</i> and <i>magrittr</i> packages. Traversing a graph in <b>R</b> gives useRs access to a myriad of simple, but powerful algorithms to explore their data sets.</p>
                        <p>This talk will show why data should be explored as a graph as well as show how a graph can be traversed in <b>R</b>. I will do this by going through a survey of different graph traversal techniques and by showing the code patterns necessary for each of those techniques.</p>

                        <p><b>Poster:</b> <a href = '../images/user2017_poster.pdf'>Exploring TIMSS at the Question-Level With R</a></p>
                        <p><b>Abstract:</b> The Trends in International Math and Science Study (TIMSS) is a series of international assessments given to 4th grade and 8th grade students around the world. It is administered by both the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) and Boston College (BC) who first conducted the assessments in 1995 and re-administered them every 4 years after that (1999, 2003, 2007, 2011, and 2015). The TIMSS dataset contains information on how every participating student answered each question on the test. The dataset also provides supplemental information on the individual student, the student's teacher,  student's school, and the student's country. While the TIMSS dataset is provided in only <b>SPSS</b> and <b>SAS</b> formats, suggesting that most analysis is done in those languages, I will use <b>R</b> to explore the TIMSS dataset. I will show how different tools in the <b>R</b> ecosystem can be used to tidy the TIMSS dataset as well as create and explore new insights in an already deep dataset. I will take a particularly deep look into how individual students and countries performed on each question. Once the dataset is cleaned, I will create different models in an attempt to predict how a student will perform on a particular question on the TIMSS tests. The process of tidying and modeling the TIMSS dataset will show how quickly and easily such tasks can be done in <b>R</b>.</p>
