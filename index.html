        <h1>Benjamin Ortiz Ulloa</h1>
        <p>I'm a data engineer who is trying to break into the field of data vizualization. The three languages that I'm most comfortable in are R, JavaScript, and Spanglish. I would love to take on any project involving data. If you would like to work with me, then please email me at <a href = 'mailto:ortizulloabenjamin@gmail.com'>ortizulloabenjamin@gmail.com</a></p>
        <p>If you want to look at some pretty cool stuff that I've done, then please take a look at my projects below. They work best on a computer using either Chrome or Firefox.</p>
        <p>If you want to look at some pretty boring stuff that I've done, then please take a look at my resume <a href = 'pages/resume.html'>here</a>. It works best if you just ignore it and go to the projects below instead.</p>
